## Why

The component model is a very basic part of Blazor and one needs to understand to be able to take advantage of it

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorComponents
   cd BlazorComponents
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template.  I have examples of several different ways to implement a component.
	1. Inline
	2. Code Behind
	3. Parent Child
	4. UI component library
